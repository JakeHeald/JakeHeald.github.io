### What did you do this past week?
For starters, I looked at all my classesâ€™ syllabi to see if I would have any exam conflicts and 
thankfully there seem to be no test conflicts that I will have to worry about this semester.
I was able to get to most of the class readings for object oriented programing, but I fell
behind on the chapter readings, only partially completing them which was slightly stressful.
### What's in your way?
I am very unfamiliar with the developer tools that I will need for the upcoming projects like
Travis. Also this upcoming project will be one of the first times I have ever coded in C++.
### What will you do next week?
I will plan out my time better as I had difficulty getting to all my readings across all my four classes. I have never had this many classes assign a lot of heavy reading before, especially
between my government and chemistry classes, which just means that I should have managed my time better from the very start of the semester.
### What's my experience of the class?
So far I really enjoy this class as it is very interactive and I love this style of teaching compared to static power points. I especially loved the lecture about learning about the small syntactical differences between C++ and Java (which was my first coding language), as it is something I tend to gloss over when it comes to programming.
### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick of the week would have to be Piazza. You may use Piazza to just connect with your classes, but it can really help connect you to companies for internships. If you go to your profile page at https://piazza.com/careers/dashboard#/my_profile, it can help companies see your achievements, languages learned, resume, and so much more.
