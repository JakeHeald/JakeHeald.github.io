### What did you do this past week?

For starters, I looked at all my classesâ€™ syllabi to see if I would have any exam conflicts and 
thankfully there seem to be no test conflicts that I will have to worry about this semester.
I was able to get to most of the class readings for object oriented programing, but I fell
behind on the chapter readings, only partially completing them which was slightly stressful.

### What's in your way?

I am very unfamiliar with the developer tools that I will need for the upcoming projects like
Travis. Also this upcoming project will be one of the first times I have ever coded in C++, however I am confident I will be able to pick up on the language quickly as I have heard it has similarities with Java, which was my first coding language.

### What will you do next week?

I will plan out my time better as I had difficulty getting to all my readings across all my four classes. I have never had this many classes assign a lot of heavy reading before, especially
between my government and chemistry classes, which just means that I should have managed my time better from the very start of the semester.

### What's my experience of the class?

So far I really enjoy this class as it is very interactive and I love this style of teaching compared to static power points. I especially loved the lecture about learning about the small syntactical differences between C++ and Java, as it is something I tend to gloss over when it comes to programming.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

My pick of the week would have to be Electron. This is a bit of code found on the electron website that you can use to allow web development languages like Javascript, along with CSS and HTML to make desktop apps. It provides a lot of different tools that help make web pages function like a local app and I personally have had a lot of fun using it to create games and other applications in my free time.
