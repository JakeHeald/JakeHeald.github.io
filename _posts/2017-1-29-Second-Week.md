title: Second Week
---
### What did you do this past week?
  This past week I have begun working on the Collatz project. I set up the Github project and synchronized it with Travis CI. Though I had initial difficulty to get it working, I finally fixed the problem by adding the travis.yml that I had forgotten. I then got the simplest solution working and then got it working with a lazy cache. The lazy cache took me a couple hours as I had a segmentation fault, it however turned out to be a one line fix. I also was able to get to and do all my chapter readings for this week.
  
### What's in your way?
   Currently I am still unclear about parts of the work flow for Collatz for using the Github Classroom and the steps leading up to submitting the project. I also have to study for the quizzes more as I have been doing poorly on the last couple of quizzes.

### What will you do next week?
   Next week I will be working on getting the rest of the HackerRank problems completed as I am currently only at a score of 27.69. I hope to increase the score to 40 using some code optimizations. If that is still not enough though, I will try to implement a meta cache for the largest cycle length for a given range.

### What's my experience of the class?
   I still enjoy the class and like learning the language of C++ even though I have been having trouble with segmentation fault errors. The quizzes are still a bit stressful though but I hope that with some extra practice and more reading I can do better on them in the future.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
   My tip of the week would be to try out Visual Studio Code. It is a free, open sourced code editor that I have used to work on most of my web development projects. It has a lot of tools and can be customized relatively simply by editing some of its files. It also has a built in formatter you can use with just a click of a button.
