title: Fourth Week
---
### What did you do this past week?
  This past week I have worked on the Australian Voting project. The project does not seem to hard and my teammate Brian and I have already gotten reading the input for the test cases and the makefile working. I also went to the AMC coding competition and used Java to solve a couple of the problems, however I was really slow and only got up to almost completing problem four as I had not coded in java in a couple months.

### What's in your way?
   Currently, I still have to finish the voting project. I still have to write the dumbest solution and then I assume I will have to add at least one optimization to get the code passing all the Hacker Rank tests.
   
### What will you do next week?
   This next week I will be writing a dumbest solution and optimizations to my Voting project with my partner. I believe the coding will not take too much time as the problem does not seem too difficult. What will take a lot of time will be the 1000 - 2000 lines of acceptance tests that my team will have to write.

### What's my experience of the class?
   I like Downingâ€™s lectures about pointers, he is really good a teaching the intricacies and when yo use * and & to achieve a desired affect. Coming from a Java background, I have never really been good at pointers and when using C I just new enough to get by in classes like CS439. So it is really great that I now have a better understanding of them through Downing's lectures.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
   My tip of the week would be to go to the career fair. Nothing is more important then getting an internship this summer and this is one of the best ways to get your resume out there. However, do not just bank on getting an internship from the career fair and just be done applying for the year and remember to apply to other companies online. So feel free to skip class just this once on the 14th and get the notes for them later to go to the career fair.
