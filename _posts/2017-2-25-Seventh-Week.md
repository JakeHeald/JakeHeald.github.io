### What did you do this past week?
  This past week I studied for and took the OPP test. Ty and I helped make a final exam test and cheat sheet for the test to help study for it as well. The test was not too hard but I believe I made a small error on one of the last questions and lost a lot of points there. I also participated in Hack UTD with my group Ty Trusty, Alfred Zhong, and our TA Eric Lee. In the 24 hours we developed a phone app called sensor strike that allowed users to play a first person shooter like Counter Strike: Global Offensive with just their android phones. The app used a Bluetooth connection to send its orientation sensor, acceleration data and button commands to a backend written in Java. I helped write the backend in Java (sorry Professor Downing in advance for not writing it in C++) to help cancel extra noise like the user's hand being too shaky by taking in mean and not moving the pointer in game if the movement of the phone was too small. Here is a link to the project: (Having Issues with Link)

### What's in your way?
   I am currently worried about the test score as I had wished I had done better as I had just made a simple mistake on the test. I have heard from previous classes that Downing ranks his students and being very competitive, I would not like being at the bottom. I also need to fix some of the issues with the Sensor Strike project as it still has some extra noise and it is also has trouble aiming the guns.
   
### What will you do next week?
   This next week I will study harder to get better grades on the quizzes. I will also probably get together later with my group to help finish up some of the issues with the Sensor Strike project.

### What's my experience of the class?
   I really enjoy the class and I found the test to be not too difficult despite a couple mistakes I made on the test. The test followed the format of multiple choice and had a lot of the coding examples we did in class where we were asked to choose the correct implementation of them.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
   My pick of the week would be to go to Hackathons. They are an extremely great experience to be introduced to new languages and API. They are also great experience when it comes to working in groups and pair programming to help accomplish unique projects and codding experiences that you would have never had working alone on your own personal projects.
