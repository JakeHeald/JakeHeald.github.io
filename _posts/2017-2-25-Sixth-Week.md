### What did you do this past week?
  This past week I went to a coding competition hosted by AMC and solved their binary tree promblem. I also studied a little bit for the upcoming test on Thursday by practicing some of the in class coding examples like any_of() and all_of().

### What's in your way?
   I am currently worried about the test as I believe that I won't have enough time to thoroughly finish all the test questions. This is because I have heard from previous students that there will be about 6 coding questions and I will only have an hour and a half to complete them all.
   
### What will you do next week?
   I will be studying for the test full time. I plan to work in a study group with a small group of close friends I have in the class and work on redoing the class coding examples and working on ones that we come up with as we go along studying. I also plan to time myself to help me learn about how fast I will need to be typing for the test.

### What's my experience of the class?
   Right now we have been learning about classes and there is alot of syntax with the C++ class setup. However Downing is really good at explaining every single detail and some things that I had glossed over. Like when I had made classes in Java, I had never really thought about what is the default privileges was.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
   My pick of the week would be to try out learning MongoDB. MongoDB is a backend that is not based off of SQL and it stores its data in the form of documents instead of the table format of SQL.
