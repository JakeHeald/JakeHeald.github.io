### What did you do this past week?
  This past week I finished up the Voting project with my partner Brian. We had an issue with the makefile that was breaking our Travis CI build on the remote repositories, but not the local repository. We managed to fix this issue by commenting out the line .PHONY: RunVoting.tmp in the makefile.

### What's in your way?
   Currently, I still have to do better on the quizzes as my score has been dipping down due to some simple mistakes. I also have to start studing for the test as it is in the format of an open coding test and I have never done anything like that before.
   
### What will you do next week?
   This next week I will probably be working on preparing for the Hack UTD competition that I am going to with my team. We are still coming up with some ideas and seeing what technology we could possible use to make a project around that will be provided at UTD. I will also study for the test a bit, however the test is still two weeks off.

### What's my experience of the class?
   I like how Downing has been teaching new concepts, like how he went over throughly how Const works in C++ with values and pointers. He even gave a memorable example of how they work about paint ball guns. I had never really used Const before in such depth, as I had only used it in Java to declare plain Constants and had never really though about what that really meant in to too much depth.                                                                                                                                                 

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
   My pick of the week would be to check out Kali Linux. If you are interested in doing any security penetration testing or database security work, Kali Linux is a really useful tool as it is a Linux based OS that has many tools for penetration and security testing.
