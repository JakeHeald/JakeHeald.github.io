### What did you do this past week?
  This past week I studied for the quizzes. I also got a partner for the next project, but I have not planned out when we are going to work over the Spring break. I also decided to get back with my Hackathon group and we have been working on our Sensor Strike project to fix up some of the issues we had with it at the UTD hackathon. 

### What's in your way?
   I currently have not read or looked too much into the project outside of class, so I will need to start planning and reading up on the project. I also have not thought out all the possible edge cases and will need to figure that out soon.
   
### What will you do next week?
  I will work on the project with my partner using screen sharing services to work on the code together. I will also try to finish up the last of the bugs on the Sensor Strike project and hopefully get it on the apple app store by coding a new version of it using Swift.

### What's my experience of the class?
   This week in class was interesting as we learning about how the project was going to work by simulating the heap. Downing explained it really well with multiple examples and a quiz question that was not to hard, but I ran out of time for it.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
   My pick of the week would be to learn Swift. Swift is a language developed for IOS development and if you ever want to make an app for IPhone, I would highly recommend learning swift to code it.
