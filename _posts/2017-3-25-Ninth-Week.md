### What did you do this past week?
  This week I finished up the final touches on the allocater project with my partner Jong Min. We had finished most of the project over the Spring Break, so all we had left was to get 90% coverage on the unit tests and write the Valid() method. I also put some more work into my website provided by UT CS by adding bootstrap to help make a menu system to travel around the site.

### What's in your way?
   I have two tests I need to study for to be prepared for next week.
   
### What will you do next week?
 I will study for my upcoming tests and then probably work on some personal projects. There should be another project for next week, so I will work on starting it early. I will also try to put a bit more work here and there to try to finish up the UT CS provided website.

### What's my experience of the class?
   The projects are not too difficult as Downing explains them very well and prepares you for them with the lectures in class. Usually the last couple of lectures involve techniques you will have to use on the project to complete it and the lecture the project is assigned is usually at least half about how to get started on the project.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
  My pick of the week would be to make your UT CS provided website. This can be done by accessing the public_html folder on the lab machines. Then adding an HTML file called index.html, the site will then be automatically created and accessed at http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~(YourCSUsername)/. You can use it to display your projects or use it as a test server for various projects you make.
