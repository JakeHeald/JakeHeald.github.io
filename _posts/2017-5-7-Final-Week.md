### How was my experiance in the class?
  I personally enjoyed Downing's Object Oriented Programing class. You get to learn a lot about how object oriented code works in addition to learning C++ if you have not already. Downing is also an excellent, engaging teacher, using a lot of humorous examples and calling on students to answer questions to help reinforce their knowledge on the subject. Downing also is very good at explaining all the nitpick differences of C++ which really helped me distinguish it from another object oriented language, Java. I would personally recommend Downing's class to any student who has not done much object oriented programing before.
