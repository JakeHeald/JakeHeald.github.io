### What did you do this past week?
  This past week I finished the collatz project with plenty of time to spare. However, I did have to make some last minute changes to my doxygen file, as I found some comments that instructed me to make changes to it in my makefile. I also studied a lot harder for the quizzes, focusing more on reviewing the last lecture and my scores on them have improved significantly.
  
### What's in your way?
   Currently, I have read little about the next project and I have not decided on a partner for the project. I am still worried about the quizzes and will have to keep studding for them.

### What will you do next week?
   This next week I will be reading for the project, I know it is a problem involving voting at the very least. I plan to start at least by Monday with a partner, hopefully.

### What's my experience of the class?
   I love the class as it goes very in depth into the fundamentals of the C++ language and Downing is very good at explaining the most efficient ways to write the basic code for C++ to maximize efficiency. I find it very useful to go over his lecture notes that he posts to Github and my own notes the day before to help refresh some of the ideas for the last lecture as the I find that the quizzes can be challenging.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
   My tip of the week would be to try out angular.js. I learned about it at my web internship this last summer and it is an amazing front end tool. To "import" it simply write src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.8/angular.min.js" inside a script tag. Angular can do many things, but one of the most useful things that I use it for is that it can help bind HTML data to one another so that it automatically updates.
